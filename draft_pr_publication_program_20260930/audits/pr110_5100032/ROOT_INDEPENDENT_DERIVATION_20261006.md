# Root independent derivation for PR110

This reconstruction addresses the ordinary unprimed focal antipedal sums for a regular closed Poncelet orbit between strictly nested confocal ellipses. It verifies the algebra independently of the submitted half-angle coordinates. Priority and publication are separate gates.

Let the outer axes be a>b>0, c²=a²−b², and the inner squared axes a²−λ,b²−λ with 0<λ<b². For one caustic-tangent chord choose outward unit normal n=(u,v), positive support ρ, and tangent t=(−v,u). Set K=a²u²+b²v². Tangency gives ρ²=K−λ. Its midpoint is M=(a²ρu/K,b²ρv/K); its half-length is l=ab√λ/K. Thus A=M−lt and B=M+lt are the outer-ellipse intersections oriented with the caustic on the left.

The two focal heights hσ=ρ−σcu satisfy h+h−=b²−λ>0 and h++h−=2ρ>0. Both are strictly positive. The foci are inside the caustic also directly: c²/(a²−λ)<1. Neither chord is focal, and the two perpendicular supporting lines defining each antipedal vertex intersect uniquely.

For arbitrary noncollinear endpoints and a focus, solving the two line equations Q·(A−f)=|A−f|² and Q·(B−f)=|B−f|² after translating the focus to zero gives q=|A−f||B−f|/dist(f,AB). This is an ordinary positive distance, not a signed norm.

For outer-ellipse points the positive focal distance is a−σcx/a. Since xA+xB=2a²ρu/K and xAxB=a²(ρ²−b²v²)/K, their product is

    Rσ = [a²hσ²+b²λ]/K.

Consequently

    qσ = [a²hσ+b²λ/hσ]/K,
    q+−q− = (2cu/K)[−a²+b²λ/(b²−λ)],
    yB−yA = 2ab√λ u/K.

The difference therefore equals Γ(yB−yA), with Γ=c[−a²+b²λ/(b²−λ)]/(ab√λ), exactly the submitted coefficient. No division by u or vertical displacement occurs, so horizontal chords are included. Γ can vanish or change sign without invalidating any positive focal height.

At each outer-ellipse point the two tangent rays to the strictly inner ellipse put the caustic on opposite sides. Nonretracing billiard/Poncelet continuation preserves the initial same-side choice along the entire orbit. We can orient the whole orbit to put the caustic on the left; then the above parametrization holds for every edge. This is a local direction choice, not global convexity or vertex-ordering. Star and repeatedly traversed orbits are covered. Reversing an orbit preserves every unoriented antipedal intersection; the orientation-dependent displacement coefficient reverses sign, and equality of the sums is unchanged.

All edges use the same λ and Γ. Summing their vertical displacements around a closed orbit yields zero; all summands are positive and finite. Hence the focal sums agree and their ratio is one for every admissible N. No parity or separately constant individual sum is required. Degenerate caustics, focal chords, retracing two-bounce limits and hyperbolic caustics are excluded by the original source's ellipse-pair setting. The circle limit is harmless wherever the construction exists, but is not needed.

Root visually checked the published source's pp.347 and349: Figure3 uses full perpendicular supporting lines, and Table7 k603 is the ratio of ordinary focal antipedal sums, value1, all periods. The source’s dated unknown-proof marker is not a current priority certificate. Full PDF/page/text bodies remain private.

The original SHA256SUMS has one stale README checksum; its seven other members match. The effective checksum file is repaired separately and the original retained. Original author/legacy programs use Python asserts; the reproduced 17,364 and1,993 checks are normal-mode evidence only. Current fresh independent explicit-require checks operate normally and under optimization. No original scientific body has been edited, no central proof-search turn added, and no novelty clearance is granted by this note.
