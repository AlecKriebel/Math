- Initialized the program in a dedicated folder.
- Adopted two independent layers: exploratory computation under `discovery/`
  and exact proof/certificate checking under `verification/`.
- Repository coordination note: the primary checkout was on another branch,
  while `main` was already checked out at `/Users/alec/Documents/Math-kissing5`.
  Work is therefore being conducted in this dedicated folder in that existing
  `main` worktree, leaving all unrelated untracked files untouched.
- First checkpoint targets:
  1. derive the exact coefficient-matrix contraction formula;
  2. prove the sharp one-copy endpoint bound;
  3. search independently for a tensorization invariant and for exact
     finite-copy witnesses.
- Derived and proved the exact formula
  \[
  Q_{\alpha,d,n}(C)=\sum_{S\subseteq[n]}\alpha^{|S|}
  \|\operatorname{Tr}_S C\|_F^2.
  \]
  In particular, at the endpoint all explicit factors of \(d\) cancel.
- Proved the sharp one-copy inequality
  \(|\operatorname{Tr}C|^2\le2\|C\|_F^2\) for rank-at-most-two \(C\), including
  its equality classification.
- Re-expressed cross terms between rank-one coefficient matrices as matrix
  elements of the positive kernel
  \(R_{d,n}=(I-\tfrac12F)^{\otimes n}\).
- Proved a useful exact obstruction: no two-term witness can work when all
  four Schmidt-side vectors factor copy by copy.  A genuine witness, if one
  exists, must use cross-copy entanglement inside at least one Schmidt-side
  vector.
- Proved all-copy parameter monotonicity: if the endpoint
  \(\alpha=-\tfrac12\) is two-block-positive for every tensor power at a
  fixed \(d\), then every \(\alpha\in[-\tfrac12,0]\) is as well.  The proof
  expands toward the identity and uses that every coefficient submatrix of a
  rank-two matrix still has rank at most two.
- Isolated the sharp quantitative all-copy conjecture
  \(Q_n(C)\ge2^{-n}(s_1-s_2)^2\), proved its sharpness at every \(n\), and
  reduced it to a coupled crossed-kernel inequality.  This remains unproved.
- Independently checked an exact reduction of the full \(d=3,n=2\) problem
  to a Ky--Fan two-singular-value inequality for
  \(D=I\otimes A+B\otimes I+zI/\sqrt6\), with traceless \(3\times3\)
  matrices \(A,B\).  The resulting finite inequality remains unproved.
- Discovery-only projected-gradient searches at \(d=3,n=2,3\) reached zero
  to floating-point precision but found no reliable negative value.
- Verified two further exact boundary facts:
  1. diagonal rank-two matrices built from strings at odd Hamming distance
     have exactly zero endpoint expectation for every \(n\);
  2. every normal rank-at-most-two coefficient matrix is nonnegative for
     two copies.
- Localized the sign in an auxiliary-qubit replica formula: all physical
  factors form a positive kernel, while the sole negative auxiliary sector
  is the one-dimensional antisymmetric subspace.  This is an exact
  reformulation, not yet a closing inequality.
- Proved that any \(d=3\) endpoint witness embeds unchanged in every
  \(d\ge3\).
- Proved a tensor-stable local-support theorem: if, at every copy, at least
  one side of the vector is supported on a subspace of dimension at most
  two, the local compression of \(X_{\alpha,d}\) is positive and so is the
  tensor product.  Hence a \(d=3\) witness needs a common site where both
  Schmidt-side planes have full local support.
- Classified equality in the local-support theorem and proved two-copy
  nonnegativity for every coefficient matrix that is phase-equivalent to a
  positive semidefinite rank-two matrix.
- Validated the exact local-compression checker independently
  (\(2^nQ=31262\) by both contractions); all accompanying C++ discovery
  sources pass syntax-only compilation.
