- Initialized the program in a dedicated folder.
- Adopted two independent layers: exploratory computation under `discovery/`
  and exact proof/certificate checking under `verification/`.
- Repository coordination note: the primary checkout was on another branch,
  while `main` was already checked out at `/Users/alec/Documents/Math-kissing5`.
  Work is therefore being conducted in this dedicated folder in that existing
  `main` worktree, leaving all unrelated untracked files untouched.
- First checkpoint targets:
  1. derive the exact coefficient-matrix contraction formula;
  2. prove the sharp one-copy endpoint bound;
  3. search independently for a tensorization invariant and for exact
     finite-copy witnesses.
- Derived and proved the exact formula
  \[
  Q_{\alpha,d,n}(C)=\sum_{S\subseteq[n]}\alpha^{|S|}
  \|\operatorname{Tr}_S C\|_F^2.
  \]
  In particular, at the endpoint all explicit factors of \(d\) cancel.
- Proved the sharp one-copy inequality
  \(|\operatorname{Tr}C|^2\le2\|C\|_F^2\) for rank-at-most-two \(C\), including
  its equality classification.
- Re-expressed cross terms between rank-one coefficient matrices as matrix
  elements of the positive kernel
  \(R_{d,n}=(I-\tfrac12F)^{\otimes n}\).
- Proved a useful exact obstruction: no two-term witness can work when all
  four Schmidt-side vectors factor copy by copy.  A genuine witness, if one
  exists, must use cross-copy entanglement inside at least one Schmidt-side
  vector.
- Proved all-copy parameter monotonicity: if the endpoint
  \(\alpha=-\tfrac12\) is two-block-positive for every tensor power at a
  fixed \(d\), then every \(\alpha\in[-\tfrac12,0]\) is as well.  The proof
  expands toward the identity and uses that every coefficient submatrix of a
  rank-two matrix still has rank at most two.
- Isolated the sharp quantitative all-copy conjecture
  \(Q_n(C)\ge2^{-n}(s_1-s_2)^2\), proved its sharpness at every \(n\), and
  reduced it to a coupled crossed-kernel inequality.  This remains unproved.
- Independently checked an exact reduction of the full \(d=3,n=2\) problem
  to a Ky--Fan two-singular-value inequality for
  \(D=I\otimes A+B\otimes I+zI/\sqrt6\), with traceless \(3\times3\)
  matrices \(A,B\).  The resulting finite inequality remains unproved.
- Discovery-only projected-gradient searches at \(d=3,n=2,3\) reached zero
  to floating-point precision but found no reliable negative value.
- Verified two further exact boundary facts:
  1. diagonal rank-two matrices built from strings at odd Hamming distance
     have exactly zero endpoint expectation for every \(n\);
  2. every normal rank-at-most-two coefficient matrix is nonnegative for
     two copies.
- Localized the sign in an auxiliary-qubit replica formula: all physical
  factors form a positive kernel, while the sole negative auxiliary sector
  is the one-dimensional antisymmetric subspace.  This is an exact
  reformulation, not yet a closing inequality.
- Proved that any \(d=3\) endpoint witness embeds unchanged in every
  \(d\ge3\).
- Proved a tensor-stable local-support theorem: if, at every copy, at least
  one side of the vector is supported on a subspace of dimension at most
  two, the local compression of \(X_{\alpha,d}\) is positive and so is the
  tensor product.  Hence a \(d=3\) witness needs a common site where both
  Schmidt-side planes have full local support.
- Classified equality in the local-support theorem and proved two-copy
  nonnegativity for every coefficient matrix that is phase-equivalent to a
  positive semidefinite rank-two matrix.
- Validated the exact local-compression checker independently
  (\(2^nQ=31262\) by both contractions); all accompanying C++ discovery
  sources pass syntax-only compilation.
- Proved an exact copy-doubling reduction: any negative rank-two witness at
  \(n\) copies produces an equal-singular-value witness at \(2n\) copies by
  antisymmetrizing its two SVD terms.  The doubled expectation is
  \(2\det H<0\).  Therefore all-copy positivity is equivalent to positivity
  on rank-two partial isometries at every copy number.
- Exactly disproved a tempting stronger compression inequality at \(n=2\):
  for explicit two-planes \(U,V\), the compression of
  \(R_2=(I-\tfrac12F)^{\otimes2}\) has trace \(11/4\) and top eigenvalue
  \((7+\sqrt{17})/8>11/8\).
- Isolated the correct weaker compression target.  Only maximally entangled
  vectors between the two code planes must be controlled:
  \(2\omega_{\rm ME}(K)\le\operatorname{Tr}K\).  In Pauli coordinates this
  is the exact \(3\times3\) inequality
  \(s_1(M)+s_2(M)-\operatorname{sgn}(\det M)s_3(M)\le\operatorname{Tr}K\).
  The explicit counterexample to the operator-norm strengthening saturates,
  rather than violates, this live inequality.
- Derived an adjoint-mixed copy-doubling construction.  A tempting block
  swap makes the resulting coefficient matrix normal, but it also changes
  the \(A_i:B_i\) copy pairing; an exact example reverses the expectation
  from \(-2\) to \(+2\).  Thus negativity cannot be transferred to the
  normal subclass by that relabeling.
- Proved the sharp two-copy quantitative identity for every
  \(H\succeq0\):
  \[
  Q_2(H)-\tfrac12\bigl(\operatorname{Tr}H^2
  -\tfrac12(\operatorname{Tr}H)^2\bigr)
  =2\operatorname{Tr}[(H\otimes H)\Pi_1^-\Pi_2^-]\ge0.
  \]
  For positive rank two this gives
  \(Q_2(H)\ge(\lambda_1-\lambda_2)^2/4\).
- Proved all-copy positivity, for arbitrary matrix rank, when the coefficient
  matrix is supported on a common tensor product of local subspaces of
  dimension at most two.  On that support the endpoint form is exactly the
  squared norm of the component traceless on every two-dimensional site.
- Derived the \(d=3\) Levi--Civita representation
  \(\operatorname{Tr}(M)I-M=\sum_kA_kM^TA_k^\dagger\).  Its partial
  tensor expansion is not termwise positive; a sparse exact \(n=3\)
  certificate saturates the resulting copositivity obstruction.
- Proved the projection-reduction theorem.  For every
  \(-1<\alpha<0\), any finite-copy negative rank-two witness first doubles
  to an equal-singular-value partial isometry \(D\), then finitely many
  orthogonal product flags turn it into a negative orthogonal rank-two
  projection.  The exact flagged expectation is
  \[
  2Q(D)+(1+\alpha)^m\{Q(P_R)+Q(P_L)\}
  +2\alpha^m\operatorname{Re}\mathcal B(P_R,P_L).
  \]
  The nuisance terms vanish while \(2Q(D)<0\) remains fixed.  Hence the
  complete all-copy endpoint question is equivalent to nonnegativity on
  two-dimensional code projectors at every copy number.
- At the \(d=3\) endpoint, obtained the explicit finite flag bound:
  if \(q=Q_n(D)<0\), any \(m\) with \(2^{-m}<-q/4\) makes the flagged
  rank-two projection negative.
- Developed the complete scalar and logical-Pauli swap enumerators of a
  two-dimensional code.  For \(n=3\), projector positivity is exactly the
  Pauli broadcast monogamy inequality
  \[
  Q_3(P)=\tfrac32-\tfrac14\sum_{i=1}^3
  \sum_{a=1}^3\|\mathcal N_i(\sigma_a)\|_2^2\ge0,
  \]
  equivalently \(E_2\ge3p_{\{1,2,3\}}\) in local swap sectors.
- Constructed exact negative pseudo-enumerators satisfying sector
  positivity, every complement/Lorentz/Pauli-Gram identity, the full
  logical sector-POVM relaxation, and natural nesting bounds.  They are
  rigorously nonrealizable.  Thus any proof must use nonlinear common-code
  (Plücker/tensor-square) compatibility, not only linear enumerator data.
- Proved the full \(d=3,n=2\) dual Ky--Fan inequality when either one of
  the two \(3\times3\) summands is normal, with the other arbitrary and
  with the scalar term present.  Also proved all embedded traceless
  \(2\times2\) simultaneous-nonnormal cores and identified broad exact
  equality families.  The genuinely three-dimensional simultaneous
  nonnormal case remains open.
