- Initialized the program in a dedicated folder.
- Adopted two independent layers: exploratory computation under `discovery/`
  and exact proof/certificate checking under `verification/`.
- Repository coordination note: the primary checkout was on another branch,
  while `main` was already checked out at `/Users/alec/Documents/Math-kissing5`.
  Work is therefore being conducted in this dedicated folder in that existing
  `main` worktree, leaving all unrelated untracked files untouched.
- First checkpoint targets:
  1. derive the exact coefficient-matrix contraction formula;
  2. prove the sharp one-copy endpoint bound;
  3. search independently for a tensorization invariant and for exact
     finite-copy witnesses.
- Derived and proved the exact formula
  \[
  Q_{\alpha,d,n}(C)=\sum_{S\subseteq[n]}\alpha^{|S|}
  \|\operatorname{Tr}_S C\|_F^2.
  \]
  In particular, at the endpoint all explicit factors of \(d\) cancel.
- Proved the sharp one-copy inequality
  \(|\operatorname{Tr}C|^2\le2\|C\|_F^2\) for rank-at-most-two \(C\), including
  its equality classification.
