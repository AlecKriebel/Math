# Preprint readiness — version 1.0.1

Scope: soundness and readiness to circulate as a preprint. No journal submission work is included. Reviews are by separate AI agents, not external human referees, and do not constitute formal proof-assistant certification or a guarantee of originality.

## Review sequence and corrections

1. **Fresh reviewer, round 1:** mathematical PASS on version 1.0.0. Its two low-severity delivery findings were first identified by the coordinator, then checked and confirmed by the reviewer. The full report is `preprint-round-1.md` in the source archive.
2. **R1-1, resolved:** version 1.0.1 adds an Availability paragraph to the standalone PDF with a direct link to the project page and its supporting files.
3. **R1-2, resolved:** the README now uses the public upload-kit download URL and explains how `build_package.py` recreates the local kit. The source archive does not recursively contain its outer upload kit.
4. **Optional improvement, completed:** added PDF title, author, subject and keyword metadata. Version identifiers were updated throughout the active source, website, citation and upload materials. Historical audits retain their original versions and hashes.
5. **Fresh reviewer, round 2: PASS, no actionable issues found at any severity.** A new reviewer independently reconstructed the proof, checked the source and reference claims, ran the verifier, inspected the PDF and archive consistency, and confirmed closure of both delivery findings. Its full report is `preprint-round-2.md` in the source archive. No additional round is required absent a material change.

The theorem, its proof, examples, literature qualifications and exact verifier are unchanged. The paper remains a three-page note. The original source's inconsistency is still explicit; the possible intended index-one question is outside the result, and priority remains qualified.

## Final disposition

**Ready to circulate as a preprint within the stated scope.** Two fresh adversarial rounds were completed, with corrections between them. The final paper and verifier remain byte-for-byte those inspected in round 2; subsequent packaging adds only the completed review report and this disposition. This is a finding of no remaining actionable issues, not a guarantee that no error could ever be found.
