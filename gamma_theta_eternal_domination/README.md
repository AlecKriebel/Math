# The γ–θ Conjecture in One-Guard Eternal Domination

This directory contains a 27-day, laptop-only research campaign on the
conjecture

> If \(\gamma(G)=\gamma^\infty(G)\), then \(\gamma(G)=\theta(G)\).

Here \(\gamma^\infty\) always means the standard **one-guard-moves** eternal
domination number: attacks occur only at unoccupied vertices and exactly one
guard traverses one edge to the attacked vertex.

## Campaign dates

- Day 1: 2026-07-25
- Day 3 review: 2026-07-27
- Day 7 review: 2026-07-31
- Day 14 review: 2026-08-07
- Day 21 review: 2026-08-14
- Day 27/final package: 2026-08-20

Finite verification or a graph-class theorem is a partial result, not a
resolution. A resolution requires a universal proof, a fully certified
counterexample, or a verified prior resolution.

## Trust architecture

- `src/verifier_a/`: bitset greatest-fixed-point implementation.
- `src/verifier_b/`: structurally independent colored configuration-digraph
  implementation.
- `src/search/`: exploratory and synthesis programs, kept separate from
  decisive checking.
- `math/`: self-contained proofs and adversarial reviews.
- `literature/`: source audit with an explicit model/variant ledger.
- `instances/`, `certificates/`, `results/`: immutable inputs, checkable
  evidence, manifests, and run logs.

No external person may be contacted on behalf of this project. If independent
outside verification would help, that need is recorded only as a research
note.

## Reproducibility status

The repository is under active construction. Consult `STATE.md` for the exact
verified frontier and `CLAIMS.md` for the status of every claim. The current
standard-library test suite is run from this directory with:

```text
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The pinned graph generator is installed locally with:

```text
tools/bootstrap_nauty.sh
```

The published 2022 catalog and its independent clique-cover certificates are
reproduced with:

```text
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m search.validate_mmv2022 \
  --catalog instances/mmv2022_table9.csv \
  --parameters results/mmv2022_parameters.csv \
  --log results/logs/mmv2022-validation.json

PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m search.certify_mmv2022_theta \
  --catalog instances/mmv2022_table9.csv \
  --certificate-dir certificates/mmv2022_theta_k3 \
  --manifest results/mmv2022_theta_certificates.csv \
  --log results/logs/mmv2022-theta-certificates.json
```

The second command independently replays every saved proof when the
certificates already exist. It never silently replaces an invalid or
mismatched certificate.
