# 9700035: expected length of a SIRSN spanning subnetwork

**Full target: unresolved.** Scoped partial result; independent review passed with the extra tail hypothesis retained.

- `PROOF.md`: the unconditional in-square asymptotic, the full-length lower bound, and the full asymptotic under t^4 P(D1>t) → 0 (in particular finite fourth moment)
- `SOURCE_AUDIT.md`: original statement, published rewording, correction of the old Steiner-network misdescription, and current primary literature
- `verify.py` / `verification.json`: 211 exact diagnostic assertions, not a SIRSN simulation or proof of the missing unconditional case
- `turns.json` / `RESEARCH_LOG.md`: two substantive attempts and the precise stopping gap
- `source_record.json` / `prior_report.json`: preserved upstream material

Model: gpt-6-astra, xhigh. No historical-priority or novel full-solution claim. Recommended queue status: **unsolved**, 2/5 substantive attempts used.

Run the modest exact checks with `python3 verify.py` (Python 3 and SymPy 1.14.0). This rewrites the local verification receipt next to the script.

The separate adversarial review in `review/` passes 3,809 independent exact controls and certifies only the stated unconditional interior and conditional full-length conclusions.
