# 10600042: an even-strand Markov formulation

**Complete algebraic reformulation of the literal source question; separate adversarial review: PASS.**

The package gives four explicit classical and eight explicit virtual algebraic move schemes whose states always have even strand count. Ordinary oriented braid closure is retained. A positive one-strand padding in the proof converts every edge of a usual Markov certificate to a named even move, including both virtual exchange directions. No unspecified odd-intermediate path is an allowed move.

Run `python3 verify_even_moves.py` with the Python standard library. It passes3219 exact assertions on280 Markov-edge cases and224 braid-relation cases. It checks syntactic lifting, supports, endpoint parity, reversibility, height rounding and permutation-cycle counts. It is not a knot-equivalence oracle or formal proof of the underlying Markov theorems.

The argument is an elementary reformulation of established results. Historical novelty is unestablished. No minimality, plat-closure substitution, framed/transverse version, or stronger bounded-support locality property is claimed.

The unchanged frozen proof passed a separate AI audit of source scope, soundness and completeness. This is not human peer review or formal verification.
