# Independent priority audit

Audit date: 2026-09-22 America/Los_Angeles / 2026-09-23 UTC. Finalized 2026-09-23 04:06:36 UTC. This is a bounded literature search, not a certificate of novelty. No person was contacted.

## Verdict

No earlier publication giving the exact odd-part theorem under only the printed slow-variation hypothesis was located in this search. The nearest verified predecessors concern regularly varying coefficient sums of Dirichlet products and asymptotic densities in multiplicative number systems. Their stated hypotheses do not immediately imply the full candidate theorem. This supports publication as an elementary note about the **printed** problem, with a qualified priority statement. It does not justify a claim that the author has settled a confirmed, correctly formulated, previously unresolved Hilberdink conjecture.

There are two separate qualifications: the 2017 source is internally inconsistent, and the elementary positive-convolution principle may have earlier appearances under different terminology. A search finding no match cannot exclude either published or folklore antecedents. Suggested wording: “We give an elementary affirmative answer to the limit-existence question under the slow-variation assumption printed in the report. We do not claim to resolve the index-one variant suggested by its accompanying prediction.”

## Source and scope

The [EMS publisher PDF](https://ems.press/content/serial-article-files/46710), printed p. 3066, states slow variation, predicts the reciprocal of the *weighted* factor \(\sum f(2^k)2^{-k}\), and gives the completely multiplicative expression \(1-f(2)/2+o(1)\). The [MFO repository version](https://publications.mfo.de/bitstream/handle/mfo/3615/OWR_2017_51.pdf?isAllowed=y&sequence=1), report p. 32, has the same mismatch. Neither retrieved version supplies a correction or solution. The mismatch predates the current catalogue transcription.

The [catalogue URL](https://www.unsolvedmath.com/problems/OWR-15956-012) failed in this agent's web fetch; its contents were not used as independent evidence here. The coordinating agent separately inspected it in the browser.

As an independent mathematical check, \(f(n)=1/n\) has \(F(x)\sim\log x\). Its odd-part ratio tends to \(1/2\), whereas the report's weighted expression is \(3/4\). Thus the constant in the report is incompatible with its literal hypothesis. Changing the hypothesis to index-one regular variation would make the completely multiplicative calculation consistent. That is evidence for an intended correction, not proof of the proposer's intent.

## Closest predecessors and exact gaps

### Yeats (2003): a verified convolution theorem

Karen Yeats, *A Multiplicative Analogue of Schur's Tauberian Theorem*, Canadian Mathematical Bulletin 46(3) (2003), 473–480, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.4153/CMB-2003-046-5), [publisher full text](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/B69D4F51393F380CA1ECC5EA584B7A4B/S0008439500020427a.pdf/multiplicative_analogue_of_schurs_tauberian_theorem.pdf).

Theorem 2 (p. 474) treats \(r=s*t\). If the summatory function \(T\) has regular variation of index \(\alpha\), and the Dirichlet series for \(s\) has abscissa of absolute convergence strictly below \(\alpha\), then \(R(x)/T(x)\to S(\alpha)\). Theorem 6 extends the setting to general Dirichlet series. The paper attributes the nonnegative-coefficient version to Burris, Theorem 9.53.

This is related, but its input regularity belongs to a factor. The present problem supplies regularity only for the product sum \(F\). Applying it with \(T=F_2\) would assume an unproved premise; applying it to the inverse local factor needs an unavailable convergence condition. For example, \(a_0=1,a_1=2,a_k=0\ (k\ge2)\) gives inverse power-series coefficients \((-2)^k\), which are not absolutely summable at zero. This example is compatible with bounded, slowly varying total sums. Therefore the candidate cannot be presented as an automatic application of Theorem 2 in its full stated generality.

### Yeats (2002): earlier factor-ratio arguments

Karen Yeats, *Asymptotic Density in Combined Number Systems*, New York Journal of Mathematics 8 (2002), 63–83, [journal full text](https://nyjm.albany.edu/j/2002/8-4p.pdf).

Sections 3.2 and 4.2 study products of multiplicative number systems. Proposition 42 is the nonnegative Schur-type result; Proposition 43 obtains zero or reciprocal-factor limits using fixed finite truncations and factor regularity. Corollary 71 treats adjoining one indecomposable. These are clear antecedents for the method and theme. Their hypotheses concern counting systems and regularity or density properties of the factors. They do not state the assertion for an arbitrary nonnegative real-valued multiplicative function given only slow variation of its total sum. In particular, arbitrary local coefficients need not arise from the free commutative counting systems in that paper.

### Bell (2004): related regular-variation theory, incomplete full-text inspection

Jason P. Bell, *Dirichlet series whose partial sums of coefficients have regular variation*, Israel Journal of Mathematics 144 (2004), 343–365, [publisher record](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02916717).

The publisher abstract concerns counting structures closed under products and extraction of irreducibles. Search-indexed Theorem 1 transfers regular variation from component counts to product counts for an Euler transform. This differs from deleting an arbitrary local factor. Search-indexed Lemmas 6–7 concern the logarithm and logarithmic derivative of that transform. The publisher's full text was not accessible, and retrieval of a separately indexed PDF failed; consequently this audit does **not** certify that every lemma in Bell's paper was checked. Bell is a relevant antecedent to cite in a longer contextual treatment, but the inspected material does not establish duplication.

[Burris's author-maintained book page](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~snburris/htdocs/density.html) independently identifies the Bell and Yeats developments. The complete book was not examined. Bell–Burris's 2011 chapter *Compton's method for proving logical limit laws* was discovered as a further broad lead; only its abstract and author bibliography were checked, not its complete proofs. These access and coverage limits remain part of the priority uncertainty.

Best-guess completion: **100% of this bounded independent audit**, not 100% confidence in originality. Strongest supported priority conclusion: **no exact prior resolution found; close older methods identified; source scope and literature-coverage reservations must remain explicit**.

## Manuscript scope recheck, 2026-09-23 04:08:42 UTC

Read `manuscript/paper.tex` and rechecked Yeats (2002), Definition 36 and Proposition 43: Property II expressly includes regular variation, and that proposition assumes Property II for both factor systems. Thus the manuscript's distinction between regularity of factors and regularity of the total is correct for the specific results compared. A refinement identifying Proposition 43 and Yeats (2003), Theorem 2 was sent to the coordinator to avoid an overly broad reference to entire papers. Both Yeats bibliographic entries agree with the primary texts. The [EMS article record](https://ems.press/journals/owr/articles/15956) confirms the report's bibliographic year, volume, issue, pages, organizers, DOI, and 19 December 2018 publication date. The manuscript's literal-problem scope, limited priority conclusion, and explicit non-resolution of the possible index-one variant are approved within this audit's stated limits. Completion of this recheck: **100%**.
