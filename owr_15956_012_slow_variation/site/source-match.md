## Catalogue

[OWR-15956-012](https://www.unsolvedmath.com/problems/OWR-15956-012), titled **Odd-Density Limits for Multiplicative Functions**, was directly inspected using the Codex browser. Direct HTTP retrieval returned 429; browser rendering succeeded. It defines F as the sum of f over n <= x and F2 as the sum over odd n <= x, assumes F(lambda x)=(1+o(1))F(x) for every fixed positive lambda, and asks whether F2/F has a limit. This is the theorem checked here, under the usual normalization f(1)=1. Nonzero is sufficient to force that normalization.

The displayed catalogue status was Open. Its literature-review date was 2026-08-21 and its only displayed source was the Oberwolfach report. This status is a dated secondary-source classification, not a priority certificate. No comment or other communication was sent.

The primary source contains the same slow-variation hypothesis. It then proposes the reciprocal of sum f(2^k)/2^k and states a completely multiplicative simplification with f(2)/2. Those two subsequent formulas are incompatible with the printed hypothesis. The standard completely multiplicative identity gives 1-f(2) under slow variation. It gives 1-f(2)/2 under regular variation of index one.

The explicit strictly positive completely multiplicative example f(n)=1/n satisfies the printed hypothesis. Its actual odd ratio is 1/2, while the printed prediction is 3/4. Thus the numerical prediction is false under the printed hypothesis; this is a proved discrepancy. A missing lambda in the hypothesis is a plausible explanation, not an established erratum or fact about the proposer's intent.

## Exact publication scope

The limit-existence question as printed and catalogued is proved for every nonzero nonnegative multiplicative f. The incompatible predicted constant is refuted and replaced with the correct constant. The possible reformulation F(lambda x)/F(x)->lambda is not resolved by this work, and its current literature status is not determined here. No claim about private or unpublished knowledge is possible.

If the convention permits the identically zero multiplicative function, the ratio is undefined. The note explicitly excludes it; under the conventional f(1)=1 definition, this adds no restriction.
